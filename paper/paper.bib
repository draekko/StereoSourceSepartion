	abstract = {With the proliferation of digital audio distribution over digital media, audio content analysis is fast becoming a requirement for designers of intelligent signal-adaptive audio processing systems. Written by a well-known expert in the field, this book provides quick access to different analysis algorithms and allows comparison between different approaches to the same task, making it useful for newcomers to audio signal processing and industry experts alike. A review of relevant fundamentals in audio signal processing, psychoacoustics, and music theory, as well as downloadable {MATLAB} files are also included.

	abstract = {The design, implementation, and evaluation of a system for automatic audio signal classification is presented. The signals are classified according to audio type, differentiating between three speech classes, 13 musical genres, and background noise. A large number of audio features are evaluated for their suitability in such a classification task, including {MPEG-7} descriptors and several new features. The selection of the features is carried out systematically with regard to their robustness to noise and bandwidth changes, as well as to their ability to distinguish a given set of audio types. Direct and hierarchical approaches for the feature selection and for the classification are evaluated and compared.},
